When we started with this project, we wanted to create an easy way to learn building RAG systems on the jvm. However, we did promise to give people a choice. Therefore we decided to create RAG4p next to RAG4j. RAG4p is a small Python framework to use RAG. Initially, it is for people to learn the different parts of a RAG system. If you are not familiar with RAG, head over to the [Documentation](/documentation) section. Here, we will explain the basic concepts.

The main project is available at [rag4p](https://github.com/RAG4J/rag4p). We are still working on documentation, testing, and preparing the code for the public. The project will first appear at [jFokus 2024](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/1642). We might make small changes based on the conference or the customer for whom we do the workshop. We will always add a blog post for each conference, to highlight what we will do at that specific event.
