And we are live! This website is the homepage of RAG4j. A small Java framework to use RAG. Initially for people to 
learn the different parts of a RAG system. If you are not familiar with RAG, head over to the [Documentation](/documentation)
section. Here we will point you to good reading material.

The main project will be available at [rag4j](https://github.com/rag4j). At the moment we are still working on JavaDoc
tests and making the code ready for public. The project will make its first appearance at [jFokus 2024](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/1642).
We might take small changes based on the conference or customer we do the workshop. We will always at a blog post to 
for each conference to highlight what we are going to do.
