And we are live! This website is the homepage of RAG4j. A small Java framework to use RAG. Initially, it is for people to
learn the different parts of a RAG system. If you are not familiar with RAG, head over to the [Documentation](/documentation)
section. Here, we will explain the basic concepts.

The main project will be available at [rag4j](https://github.com/RAG4J/rag4j). We are still working on JavaDoc, testing, and preparing the code for the public. The project will first appear at [jFokus 2024](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/1642).
We might make small changes based on the conference or the customer for whom we do the workshop. We will always add a blog post for each conference, to highlight what we will do at that specific event.
