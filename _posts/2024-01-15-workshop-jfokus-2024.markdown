From 5 to 7 Februari 2024 Daniel and Jettro visit Stockholm for the annual jFokus conference. On monday we will perform
our workshop [Creating a Semantic Search-Based Question-Answering System with LLMs](https://www.jfokus.se/talks/1642).
This is the first occasion where we use our RAG4j project to teach a group of enthusiast about the different aspects of
Retrieval Augmented Generation. We will use the project to show the different parts of a RAG system. There is plenty of
time to experiment with the different parts. As the project is small, not a lot of time is lost to learn the project.

People attending the workshop will start from the beginning and perform all the different steps needed to build and
evaluate a RAG system. To give you an idea of the different steps, here is a list of the different steps:
- Work with text, use a splitter to split the text into sentences or other chunks.
- Use an embedder to create vectors from the chunks
- Use a retriever to find the most relevant chunks for a given question
- Use a generator to generate text based on the chunks and the question
- Use a quality component to determine the quality of the generated text and the relevance of the retrieved chunks

We hope to see you in Stockholm and we hope you will enjoy the workshop. If you have any questions, feel free to contact
us.
