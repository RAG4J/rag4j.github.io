The Rag4p project is started to facilitate workshops. When working on other projects, I was copying the code from the 
Rag4p project to the project I was working on. This was not very efficient. Therefore I decided to make the project 
available on PyPi. This way I can use the project as a dependency in other projects.

[The project is available on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rag4p/)

The source code of the project is available on [Github](https://github.com/RAG4J/rag4p)

## DSPy - Programming Language Models using Python
This is a sample application to learn about DSPy. DSPy separates the flow of your program in modules from the 
parameters like prompts and weights optimisation. It is a nice framework to create RAG, ReAct, and ChainOfThought
programs. The framework is available on [Github](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)

You can find the [Documentation](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app) here.

The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/jettro/dspy-wordpress). At the moment this project is under
development. The project demonstrates how to import content from a wordpress blog into Weaviate and use DSPy to 
create a RAG and a multi step RAG solution.
