Welcome to the homepage of RAG4j. _RAG_ is short for Retrieval Augmented Generation. RAG has become famous for the power
to help Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text that is more coherent and relevant to the given context. The _4j_
has become famous for being a java framework.

In the land of Python, there are a lot of frameworks available that can help you to use RAG. But in the land of Java,
there is not a lot of choice. We like the framework [Langchain4j](https://langchain4j.org) a lot, but is has become 
big and not focussed on RAG. So we decided to create a new framework that is focussed on RAG and is easy to use.

The main focus of RAG4j is teaching people the power of RAG. We want to make it easy to use RAG and we want to make it
easy to understand how RAG works. We use this project for workshops. With the knowledge from this project, you can
easily switch to other bigger frameworks that give you a lot more than RAG. We stick to RAG.

One part of the project is something not all framework have, that is a way to determine the quality of your RAG system.
We got our inspiration from the [TruLens](https://trulens.ai) project. We tried to keep it as simple as possible to
use.

Hope you like the project. Feel free to contact us if you have questions or remarks.
