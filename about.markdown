We developed this project to learn and to teach. We have a lot of experience with search based systems. With the power
of Large Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation, we see a lot of possibilities to improve search based
systems. We started out using a lot of Python frameworks, but we wanted to use Java. Of course there is the framework
[Langchain4j](https://langchain4j.org), but we wanted to create something that is focussed on RAG and is easy to use 
as well as easy to extend. We wanted to have RAG quality integrated in the framework. We got our inspiration from the
[TruLens](https://trulens.ai) project. We tried to keep it as simple as possible to use.
