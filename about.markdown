We developed this project to learn and to teach. We have a lot of experience with search-based systems. With the power of Large Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation, we see a lot of possibilities to improve search-based systems. We started using many Python frameworks and the Java Langchain4j project. We wanted to create something focused on RAG that is easy to use and extend. We wanted to have RAG quality integrated into the framework. In the [TruLens](https://trulens.ai) project, we found inspiration to embed a quality metric using Large Language Models. We tried to keep it as simple as possible to use. Head to the [documentation](/documentation) page to learn more about the framework.
